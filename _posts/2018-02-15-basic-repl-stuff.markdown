``` sh
$ scala
scala> val x = "hello"
x: String = hello
```
The `x` above is a `val`, meaning, if you try to assign any other value to `x`, you would get an error. These are Scala’s immutable. We have assigned a String value to this val which is what the Scala interpreter prints out for you.

`x: String //This is how we define objects to be of a certain type.`

## Exercises:
1. See what happens if you try to re-assign a value to this val.
2. What happens if you don’t use the keyword ‘val’?
3. Carry out other type assignments - Int, etc.
