The motivation behind this tutorial/workbook/series is to provide a guided training in the Scala programming language, which aims to be lightening fast yet gentle.

We’ll use a “15 minutes each day” approach to learning this fascinating programming language. You would get a lot better, a lot faster if you spend more time practicing however, if you just remember the constructs explained here you can start to be productive in about 15 days or less!

Prerequisites:
Experience with any imperative programming language like Java, Python. This guide is written for OSX environment, the things that would change if you are on other platforms are installation/invocation related.
